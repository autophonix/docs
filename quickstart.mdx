This guide walks you through setting up ThunderPhone to handle your first AI-powered phone call.

## Prerequisites

<Info>
  You'll need a ThunderPhone account. [Sign up](https://app.thunderphone.com) if you haven't already.
</Info>

## Step 1: Get Your API Token

<Steps>
<Step title="Log into ThunderPhone Dashboard">
  Go to [app.thunderphone.com](https://app.thunderphone.com) and sign in to your account.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to Settings">
  Click on **Settings** in the sidebar, then select **API Keys**.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate a Token">
  Click **Create API Key** and copy your token. Store it securely—you won't be able to see it again.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Create Your First Agent

An agent defines how your AI handles conversations—including the system prompt, voice, and any tools it can use.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.thunderphone.com/v1/orgs/{org_id}/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Customer Support",
    "prompt": "You are a friendly customer support agent for Acme Corp. Help customers with their questions about orders, returns, and product information. Be concise and helpful.",
    "voice": "en-US-Standard-Journey-D",
    "product": "spark"
  }'
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.thunderphone.com/v1/orgs/{org_id}/agents",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_TOKEN",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "name": "Customer Support",
        "prompt": "You are a friendly customer support agent for Acme Corp. Help customers with their questions about orders, returns, and product information. Be concise and helpful.",
        "voice": "en-US-Standard-Journey-D",
        "product": "spark"
    }
)

agent = response.json()
print(f"Created agent with ID: {agent['id']}")
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.thunderphone.com/v1/orgs/${orgId}/agents`,
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Token YOUR_API_TOKEN',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: 'Customer Support',
      prompt: 'You are a friendly customer support agent for Acme Corp. Help customers with their questions about orders, returns, and product information. Be concise and helpful.',
      voice: 'en-US-Standard-Journey-D',
      product: 'spark'
    })
  }
);

const agent = await response.json();
console.log(`Created agent with ID: ${agent.id}`);
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  **Product options:** Choose `spark` for the fastest response times, `bolt` for balanced performance, or `zap` for highest quality.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Provision a Phone Number

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.thunderphone.com/v1/orgs/{org_id}/phone-numbers \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "inbound_agent_id": 12
  }'
```

```python Python
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.thunderphone.com/v1/orgs/{org_id}/phone-numbers",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_TOKEN",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "inbound_agent_id": 12  # Use the agent ID from Step 2
    }
)

phone = response.json()
print(f"Your new number: {phone['number']}")
```
</CodeGroup>

Save the returned phone number—this is the number callers will dial to reach your AI agent.

## Step 4: Configure Webhooks (Optional)

For real-time notifications and dynamic call configuration, set up a webhook endpoint:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://api.thunderphone.com/v1/orgs/{org_id}/webhook \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-server.com/thunderphone-webhook"
  }'
```

ThunderPhone will send events to your endpoint for:
- **`call.incoming`** — When a call starts (return agent config to override)
- **`call.complete`** — When a call ends (includes transcript and recording URL)

See [Webhooks](/webhooks/overview) for implementation details.

## Step 5: Test Your Agent

Call your new phone number! The AI agent will answer and respond according to your configured prompt.

You can view call details in the dashboard or via the API:

```bash
curl https://api.thunderphone.com/v1/orgs/{org_id}/calls \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```
