The ThunderPhone API uses token-based authentication. All requests must include a valid authentication header.

## Authentication Methods

### Token Authentication

For API requests, include your token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Token YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl https://api.thunderphone.ai/v1/orgs/{org_id}/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.thunderphone.ai/v1/orgs/{org_id}/agents",
    headers={"Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_TOKEN"}
)
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.thunderphone.ai/v1/orgs/${orgId}/agents`,
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Token YOUR_API_TOKEN'
    }
  }
);
```
</CodeGroup>

### Session Authentication

When using the ThunderPhone dashboard, authentication is handled via browser cookies (session auth). This is managed automatically by the web application.

## Getting Your API Token

1. Log into the [ThunderPhone Dashboard](https://app.thunderphone.ai)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Copy and securely store your token

<Warning>
  Keep your API token secure. Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.thunderphone.ai/v1
```

## ID Format

All resource IDs in the ThunderPhone API are integers (auto-incrementing primary keys).

```json
{
  "id": 12,
  "name": "Customer Support Agent"
}
```

## Health Check

Verify API connectivity:

```bash
curl https://api.thunderphone.ai/v1/healthz
```

Response:
```json
{"ok": true}
```

## Error Responses

The API returns standard HTTP status codes:

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `200` | Success |
| `201` | Created |
| `204` | No Content |
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing token |
| `403` | Forbidden - Insufficient permissions |
| `404` | Not Found - Resource doesn't exist |
| `500` | Internal Server Error |

Error responses include a message:

```json
{
  "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
}
```
