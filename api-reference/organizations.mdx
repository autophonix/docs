Organizations are the top-level container for all your ThunderPhone resources—phone numbers, agents, and calls.

## Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/v1/orgs/` | List organizations |
| `POST` | `/v1/orgs/` | Create organization |
| `GET` | `/v1/orgs/:org_id/` | Get organization |
| `PATCH` | `/v1/orgs/:org_id/` | Update organization |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/orgs/:org_id/` | Delete organization |

## List Organizations

Retrieve all organizations you have access to.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl https://api.thunderphone.ai/v1/orgs/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.thunderphone.ai/v1/orgs/",
    headers={"Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_TOKEN"}
)
orgs = response.json()
```
</CodeGroup>

## Webhook Configuration

ThunderPhone sends all outbound webhook events to a single org-level URL. Configure this to receive real-time notifications about calls.

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/v1/orgs/:org_id/webhook` | Get webhook configuration |
| `PUT` | `/v1/orgs/:org_id/webhook` | Set webhook URL |
| `PATCH` | `/v1/orgs/:org_id/webhook` | Update webhook URL |

### Set Webhook URL

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X PUT https://api.thunderphone.ai/v1/orgs/{org_id}/webhook \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-server.com/thunderphone-webhook"
  }'
```

```python Python
response = requests.put(
    f"https://api.thunderphone.ai/v1/orgs/{org_id}/webhook",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_TOKEN",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "url": "https://your-server.com/thunderphone-webhook"
    }
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Response

```json
{
  "url": "https://your-server.com/thunderphone-webhook",
  "secret": "whsec_abc123...",
  "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

<Note>
  The `secret` is generated by ThunderPhone and used to sign webhook payloads. Store it securely to verify incoming webhooks.
</Note>

### Webhook Events

All webhook event types are sent to this single URL. The `type` field determines the event:

- **`call.incoming`** — A call has started, respond with agent configuration
- **`call.complete`** — A call has ended, includes transcript and recording URL

See [Webhooks](/webhooks/overview) for detailed payload documentation.
